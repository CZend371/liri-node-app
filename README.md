The LIRI(Language Interpretation and Recognition Interface) is an application that will run on any computers computer line interface. It is able to retrieve song information by using the command spotify-this-song. It will give you the artist,album and preview link for the song. It is able to get you concert dates for any artist/band you desire. By simply using the concert-this command you will get a venue, location, and date for the concert.
It can also retreive any information you would like for a movie! By using the movie-this command it will bring up the the year it was released, rating, plot, country of origin, languages it's in available in, as well as the actors in that movie.
If you don't know what to search for just give the command do-what-it-says for a random search!
I used Node.js to run the program along with Visual Studio Code.
